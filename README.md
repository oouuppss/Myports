# Myports

This script is base on "ports" script, which can be found in nutyx distribution http://www.nutyx.org.
It was original created for crux distribution By Per Liden https://crux.nu/Profiles/PerLiden.

I reworked it from "nearly" scratch, because:
	1) i love shell.
	2) i want to learn how source Gnu/Linux distribution works.
	3) why not.

Any idea or improvement are welcome.
Thanks.
